            <h1>Mechanical Walking Rickshaw</h1>
            <h4>In the process of creating the mechanical walking rickshaw, we were tasked with creating five concept sketches to aid in developing our final CAD design.</h4>
            
            <div class="rickshaw-row">
                <div class="rickshaw-col">
                    <h3>Concept Drawing #1</h3> 
                    <img src="images/rickshaw-concept-1.jpg" alt="Rickshaw Concept 1" />
                    <p>For the first concept, we noticed a couple issues: incorrect suspension usage, complex steering mechanism, and an over-functioning motor.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="rickshaw-col">
                    <h3>Concept Drawing #2</h3> 
                    <img src="images/rickshaw-concept-2.jpg" alt="Rickshaw Concept 2" />
                    <p>After fixing the previous issues, we noticed unnecessary elevation between the carriage and the walking mechanism.</p>
                
                    <div class="rickshaw-col">
                        <h3>Concept Drawing #4</h3> 
                        <img src="images/rickshaw-concept-4.png" alt="Rickshaw Concept 4" />
                        <p>In the fourth concept, we needed to fix the bounciness that was a result of the third concept.</p>
                    </div>
                
                </div>
                <div class="rickshaw-col">
                    <h3>Concept Drawing #3</h3> 
                    <img src="images/rickshaw-concept-3.png" alt="Rickshaw Concept 3" />
                    <p>For this concept, we decided to strengthen and shorten the "legs" of the rickshaw decrease weight while providing more support. </p>
                <div class="rickshaw-col">
                    <h3>Concept Drawing #5</h3> 
                    <img src="images/rickshaw-concept-5.png" alt="Rickshaw Concept 5" />
                    <p>For our fifth concept, we altered the suspension and legs. This changes increased the overall stability and efficiency. </p>

                </div>

            <h4>After completing the concept sketches, we created the final prototype design.</h4>
            <div class="rickshaw-row-2">
                <div class="rickshaw-pro-col">
                    <h3>Final Prototype Design</h3> 
                    <img src="images/rickshaw-final-prototype.jpg" alt="Rickshaw Concept 3" />
                    <p>These final changes helped us produce our final prototype, which functions successfully. We wanted to ensure that at the minimum, our prototype had the ability to travel at a speed of 0.1m/s and have the ability to steer and brake. We also implemented a suspension system, gear-reduction, and all-terrain functionality.</p>
